# Dashboard Component

The Dashboard component is the central interface of NewsSense Financial, providing users with a comprehensive view of financial instruments, charts, news, and market analysis.

## Component Architecture

```tsx
const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  // State management for financial instruments, news, etc.
  // Handles instrument selection, search functionality, and data fetching
  // Renders the main dashboard interface
};
```

## Features

- Displays price history with customizable timeframes
- Shows price movement patterns
- Includes volume indicators
- Supports zooming and interaction

### Financial Instrument Selection

Users can select financial instruments through:
- A search function with autocomplete
- Predefined lists of popular stocks
- Recent selections history
- Category-based browsing

### News Tabs

The dashboard organizes news in three distinct tabs:

1. **Relevant News**: News directly related to the selected instrument
2. **All News**: General financial news that may be of interest
3. **Market Analysis**: AI-generated analysis of market conditions

### Market Metrics

Key financial metrics are displayed for each instrument:
- Current price and change percentage

- 52-week performance

## Usage

The Dashboard component is the main entry point for user interaction. It manages:

- Data fetching for financial instruments
- News retrieval and categorization
- User interface state
- Navigation between different data views

## Implementation Details

The Dashboard component implements several key functions:

### Data Fetching

```tsx
const fetchInitialData = async () => {
  // Fetch initial stocks, news, and market data
};

const handleSearch = async (query: string) => {
  // Search for instruments based on user query
};

const handleInstrumentSelect = async (instrumentId: string) => {
  // Fetch details for a selected instrument
};
```

### UI Management

```tsx
// Tab management for news sections
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<string>("relevant-news");

// Responsive layout considerations
const [windowWidth, setWindowWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
```

## Styling

The Dashboard uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with responsive design principles that adapt to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

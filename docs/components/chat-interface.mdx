# Chat Interface Component

The ChatInterface component provides an intelligent conversational interface that allows users to ask questions about financial markets, stocks, and news using natural language.

## Component Architecture

```tsx
const ChatInterface: React.FC = () => {
  // State management for chat messages and input
  // Handles message processing and API calls
  // Renders the chat interface UI
};
```

## Features

### Intelligent Query Processing

The chat interface intelligently processes user queries to:
- Identify stock-related questions
- Recognize specific financial instruments
- Handle market trend inquiries
- Respond to news-related questions

### Stock Price Information

The chat assistant provides accurate stock price information with:
- Current trading prices
- Change percentage
- Currency-appropriate formatting
- Special handling for Indian stocks (â‚¹) vs US stocks ($)

### Predefined Response Patterns

The component includes specialized response patterns for common queries:
- Stock price inquiries (e.g., "What is the MRF stock price?")
- IPO information
- Profitability metrics
- Market share analysis
- Financial forecasts

### Web Information Search

For questions without predefined answers, the component:
- Extracts key information from the query
- Searches for relevant financial information
- Formats responses in a user-friendly manner
- Provides source attribution when appropriate

## Usage

The ChatInterface component appears in the sidebar of the main dashboard and allows users to:
- Type natural language questions about finances
- Receive AI-generated responses with accurate information
- Get follow-up suggestions for deeper exploration
- Access stock-specific details through conversation

## Implementation Details

The ChatInterface component implements several key functions:

### Message Processing

```tsx
const processSpecificQuery = (query: string): string | null => {
  // Process queries with predefined answers
  // Return null if no predefined answer is available
};

const searchWebForInfo = async (query: string): Promise<string> => {
  // Process general queries by searching for information
  // Generate appropriate responses based on query type
};
```

### Stock Price Handling

```tsx
// Enhanced stock price lookup for any stock name/symbol
if (keywords.includes("stock") && keywords.includes("price")) {
  // Extract potential stock name or symbol
  // Check against known stock database
  // Format response with appropriate currency symbol
}
```

### Message Display

```tsx
{messages.map((message) => (
  <div
    key={message.id}
    className={`flex ${
      message.isUser ? "justify-end" : "justify-start"
    }`}
  >
    <div
      className={`max-w-[80%] p-3 rounded-lg ${
        message.isUser
          ? "bg-blue-500 text-white"
          : "bg-gray-100 text-gray-900"
      }`}
    >
      <p className="whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">
        {message.content}
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
))}
```

## Styling

The ChatInterface uses a card-based design with:
- Clear visual distinction between user and assistant messages
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Smooth scrolling to latest messages
- Input field with send button
